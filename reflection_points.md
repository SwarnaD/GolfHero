 * Tell us about tools/techniques/conventions that worked well for your team. Explain why.
 
 - Discord chat with separated sections for discussing different types of content helped us to stay organized and keep all group members informed.
 - Discord chat allowed continuous communication throughout the project and allowed for more granularity in development goals (we didn't have to wait until the next sprint to address something).
 - Creating multiple scenes and duplicates of scenes for multiple members to work on the same scene. This was a workaround to Unity's limitations with regards to editing work within the same scene.

 * Tell us about tools/techniques/conventions that didn't work well for your team. Explain why.

 - Strict sprint structure (meetings and deadlines) didn't work with our schedules as it was rare for everyone to be available at the exact same hour. 3 sprints and strict deadlines allowed for very little room in accommodating unforeseen development hiccups/quirks, especially considering we had limited knowledge of how much work certain things would take within Unity despite our best estimates.
 - Organization of our hierarchies between scenes and the overall assets, could have used more consistent naming conventions and folder structures.
 - Unity itself is not particularly suited for collaboration in large numbers (six people) due to how scene editing works. Unreal Engine 4 could prove to be a better option if we were to look into it.

 * If you had to continue working as a team, and design your process, what would your process look like? In other words, describe an ideal process __for your team__, based on your experience working together.
   
 - We would continue to use pivotal tracker and the overall agile/sprint structure but each phase/sprint would be far more granular (shorter but more frequent). Items would be added to PT and discussed in a continuous manner and concerns/issues can be addressed sooner to handle development bottlenecks (like multiplayer functionality gating development of specific features in our case).
 - Possibly use the integrated Unity collaboration tools to more easily allow the team to edit different and similar parts without as many conflicts. For programming with some funding, Scene Fusion could prove to be a more efficient method of collaboration on the same scenes (it syncs up work on the fly so that there will be no conflicts). http://www.kinematicsoup.com/
