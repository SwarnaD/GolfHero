# Sprint 1 Release Planning Meeting

## Participants:
**John Fraser**
**Swarnajyoti Datta**
**Karen Ngo**
**Bryan Delgado-Bosso**
**Michael Chiu**
**Zixing Gong**
**Eugenia (Yujia) Zhang**

## Release Goals:
- Have a simple sandbox mode with basic physics and camera movement implemented

## Sprint 1 User Stories:
- Focus on user stories that give us a playable golf game
-- Example story completion order: sandbox stage* (1)**, set up camera (2), golf ball and interactions (4), implement the golf hole (7)

*The names given to the stories above are just for convenience. Refer to sprint1.md or PB.md for the full user story
**The numbers are an identifier for the corresponding user story in PB.md

The user stories above (1, 2, 4, and 7) are the minimum requirements for our sprint 1 release. No other stories are
planned for sprint 1 as they are not essential to the release goal and due to the issue below.

## Issues:
Need to get familiar with Unity and C#. This is a common point brought up by most members of the team and is also reflected in our product backlog. Because we are in the process of learning the technologies we are using for our project, the size and priority of our user stories and their task breakdowns may not be very accurate. As such, throughout the duration of sprint 1, we plan on increasing the accuracy of our user stories as we become more comfortable with Unity and C#.
