## General Flow:
1. Introduction(memebers and roles)
2. Product introduction
    - Highlight features that make us different competition.
      1. 3D graphics
      2. In-game text chat
      3. Simple easy to setup multiplayer
3. Demo Preamble (Instructions, volunteers, etc.)
4. Do the Live Demo
    - Talk about features during demo as they pop up
      1. Great Gameplay
        - Interesting Physics (Snowman, Rocket Launcher)
        - Controls
      2. Multiplayer
        - Matchmaking
        - Text Chat
      3. "¡¿Fun Little Features?!" (Placeholder)
5. Talk about process
    - Talk about GitHub (under Technical Challenges)

    - Communication, Standards and Conventions
        1. IRL
        - Most of us were in the same tutorial and held mini-meetings after tut
        2. Discord
        - Pinned messages
        - Different text and voice chat channels
        3. Schedules did not align for many in person meetings
        - Discord allowed us to conveniently save meeting details in dedicated text channels for those who were unable to attend
6. Software Architecture
    - Technologies (Unity and C#)
        - Brief overview of Unity stuff
            - Scenes
            - Prefabs
            - Scripts
            - Object Hierarchy and its items
    - How was the software built?
    - Technical Challenges
        1. Unfamiliarity with Unity led to an unproductive start to the project, was mainly reading, learning about Unity and C#
        2. Unity and Github did not play nice with each other
        - Explain this was due to how Unity's Scenes are stored (as a single file) which makes it impossible for multiple people to work on the same Scene concurrently as merging would become an issue
        3. Complain about people not informing others of when they push
        4. Talk about various bugs, how we found and then squashed them
        - Camera colliding with objects and getting the view blocked
        - Arrow kept dying for some reason (complain about Unity breaking things randomly)
        - Things broke when ported over to multiplayer due to completely different structure
