This is a golf game featuring Kirby as the golf ball. It has multiplayer. The player must first touch all the enemies before revealing the hole.
 
Since our game is 3D, it will make it easier to plan shots. Kirby's Dream Course sufferes from dated graphics which would struggle to entice newer and younger players, where as our game will have more modern graphics. The company could remaster the game or completely remake it, however these undertakings would be costly and is usually done for games they are sure will sell millions of copies. Kirby's Dream Course is limited to only a select few Nintendo consoles, which means if you do not have Nintendo specific hardware you will not be able to play. Our game will be targeted at computers as more people have access to desktop computers and laptops than they do to very game specific hardware. The users vary from non gamers to avid gamers so having a platform that is readily availiable to the masses loosens the requirements to be able to play our game. The competitors did not focus on casual users since at the time, video games were not as common place as they were today. Video games for the computer were in its infancy and computers did not exist in almost every household. In addition to that game consoles we more of a luxury compared to how common place they are today. For HAL Laboratory and Nintendo EAD (the developers of Kirby's Dream Course) to port the game to computer would require them to recode certain aspect of the game to make it run on modern computer platforms, but this is time consuming and Nintendo doesn't traditionally have a presence in the computer gaming market. An alternative would to change their stance on Emulators and ROMs and allow the purchase of ROMs digitally or develop their own emulator.
