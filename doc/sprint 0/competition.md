Total Pro Golf 3 is a single player Golf simulator that’s is played using a birds-eye view on a 2D course. The game is strictly single player.

Our game is different in that it will incorporate multiplayer, allowing players to play with friends and others. The multiplayer will also feature an online chat allowing you to interact with the other players. The UI will be more intuitive and take up less of the screen. Total Pro Golf 3 targets a more niche player base; they focus more on the single player aspect along with aspects of living a life like a pro golf player would (entering tournaments and etc.). Our game has a more casual approach making it easy to pick up.

This is a golf game featuring Kirby as the golf ball. It has multiplayer. The player must first touch all the enemies before revealing the hole.
 
Since our game is 3D, it will make it easier to plan shots. Kirby's Dream Course suffers from dated graphics which would struggle to entice newer and younger players, where as our game will have more modern graphics. The company could remaster the game or completely remake it, however such undertakings would be costly. Kirby's Dream Course is limited to only a select few Nintendo consoles, which means if you do not have Nintendo specific hardware you will not be able to play. Our game will be targeted at computers as more people have access to desktop computers and laptops than they do to very game specific hardware. The users vary from non-gamers to avid gamers so having a platform that is readily available to the masses loosens the requirements to be able to play our game. The competitors did not focus on casual users since at the time, video games were not as common place as they were today. For HAL Laboratory and Nintendo EAD (the developers of Kirby's Dream Course) to port the game to computer would require them to recode certain aspects of the game to make it run on modern computer platforms, but this is time consuming and Nintendo doesn't traditionally have a presence in the computer gaming market and they are firmly against emulators.
