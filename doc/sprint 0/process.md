## Team Organization

Everyone will be programming in C# within Unity. We have currently decided on tentative roles to be emphasized or added on to specific members:

* Programming Lead: John Fraser 
  - John's prior experience with Unity makes him the best candidate for leading the structure and design of the program, especially for sprint 1.
* Project Manager: Zixing Gong
  - A designated project manager to handle course/project logistics and to communicate with the programmers to ensure deadlines are met would be beneficial.

Beyond sprint 1, roles will be re-evaluated and more specialized ones will be identified and created when appropriate. Group members have expressed interest in areas of model creation, level design, and multi-player networking.

## Decision Making

Decisions on all aspects of development thus far (project idea, tools to be used, team organization, etc.) have been made based on group consensus. Individual components of course documentation have been worked on by volunteers.

## User Stories

User stories have been prioritized based on group consensus within the MoSCoW paradigm. Categorizations of each story fall into one of the following:
* M(ust)
* S(hould)
* C(ould)
* W(on't)

Additionally, the group has elected to use pointerpoking.com as a tool to carry out scoring sessions.

## Meetings/Communication

We have had partial group meetings during/after tutorial sessions but our main means of communication has been through a Discord group with daily regularity.

## Next Phase
Aspects of this project are uncertain based on general unfamiliarity with Unity. A smooth pre-development phase is a good sign of our synergy and we hope that it will reap benefits when tackling sprint 1. Good, early, and consistent communication will be key to our success.
