# Product Backlog

## User Stories

> We used the [MoSCoW](https://dzone.com/articles/6-backlog-prioritization) system to assign priority for each user story.
> M = MUST have this; S = SHOULD have this if at all possible; C = COULD have this if it does not effect anything else.
> W = WON'T have this time but would like in the future.
> 
> We used this [Planning Poker](https://www.pointingpoker.com/) tool to estimate our user story sizes.
