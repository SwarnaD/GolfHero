## Key Scenarios

* A gamer is bored and wants to kill some time with an easy-to-play online game. They run our game, join or host a server and get started right away. Varied levels and obstacles keep them hooked.
* A non-gamer is invited to play this game by their friends. They join their friend's game and are instantly hooked by the concept. The game is easy enough to digest and they continue to play.

* Rewarding gameplay: players should find the game enjoyable and varied enough to want to continue playing
